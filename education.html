        <h2>Allow me to share this experience.</h2>
        <br></br>
        <h3 id="h3-1">
            On March 14, 2022, at 12:30 p.m., I completed my SPM exam by taking the final paper, Science 2. 
            This is the end of my SPM adventure. However, this voyage does not come without its hurdles. 
            When the COVID-19 epidemic struck, the school system experienced significant transformation. 
            Schools closed, and face-to-face schooling transitioned to online learning. Initially, I struggled to 
            adapt to this strategy. Learning online necessitates strong self-discipline and time management skills.
            I frequently encounter technological issues, such as a poor internet connection and distractions at home,
            which can break my focus.
        </h3>
        <h3 id="h3-2">
            Even so, I didn't give up. I'm attempting to adjust to this new environment. I make a comfortable study place 
            at home and ensure that I have all of the essential resources, such as reference books and a reliable internet connection.
            I have created a rigid plan to ensure that I do not fall behind in my academics. I pay close attention in all of my online 
            lessons and aggressively ask questions if I don't understand. I practice continual learning by devoting extra time to things 
            that I find difficult. I also allocated aside time to study textbooks, revise, and answer previous exam questions.
        </h3>
        <h3 id="h3-3">
            In addition, I also take additional classes online. The teachers help a lot in terms of providing support by providing various 
            additional learning materials and review sessions. The same goes for my parents who are unwavering in their support. 
            They make sure I have all the learning needs, give moral encouragement, and help manage the home environment to be conducive to learning. 
            I shall never forget their assistance ‚ù§.

        <h3>Day after day passed, and now it's time for the thrilling day which is on Thursday 8 June, 
            the results of the Malaysia Certificate of Education 2022 will be announced. Finally, my efforts paid off with excellent results in SPM. 
            My journey to achieve success in SPM was not an easy one. It requires seriousness, perseverance, and high commitment. 
            Since the beginning of the year, I have set myself the goal of achieving excellent results in this important test. 
            I would like to proudly share that I have achieved my SPM results with flying colors. Although my results were not as good as they were, 
            I am still proud of my hard work in planning my study schedule, attending online classes, and using effective learning techniques such as 
            mind maps and short notes, which have yielded positive results. This experience taught me that with discipline, determination, and support, 
            I can overcome challenges and achieve success even in difficult circumstances. SPM becomes an important stepping stone, opening the door to future opportunities.</h3>
